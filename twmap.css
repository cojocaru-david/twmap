  Description: This CSS file was automatically generated by twmap, a CLI tool that scans HTML, JSX, and TSX files to extract Tailwind utility classes and generates optimized CSS mappings with short class names.
  - Consistent mapping: Same utility string always generates the same short class name
  - Multiple modes: hash, incremental, or readable class name generation
  - Fast, configurable, and safe: see project links above for documentation

  Do not edit this file manually.
